# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe Game**! This is a console-based version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using **C**. It's an interactive game where two players take turns marking cells on a grid with either "X" or "O". The game ends when one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw. 🏁

## ✨ Features

- **Colorful Display**: Enjoy color-coded board representation using Windows console colors.
- **Player Interaction**: Players take turns entering row and column values to place their marks.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when a player gets a line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Condition**: If the board is full and there’s no winner, it results in a draw.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid moves are caught, and players are prompted to try again.

## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions

1. **Goal**: Form a row, column, or diagonal with your marks ("X" or "O") to win.
2. **Input**: Players enter the row and column numbers (e.g., 2 3) to place their marks on the board.
3. **Winning**: The first player to form a line of three marks wins the game.
4. **Draw**: If all the cells are filled and no player has won, it results in a draw.
